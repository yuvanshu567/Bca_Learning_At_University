//Task is to find out passed as well as failed students.
//Given the score of 'N' students in the class, write a program to compute the maximum score. Use array to store the marks of the students and assume that the maximum number of students
// in a class is 50. Assume that -1 is used to indicate a student who is absent for the exam. Assume that a student should secure a minimum of 50 marks to pass the exam.
